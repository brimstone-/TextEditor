### Installation and use
Surprise, there's no installation! Simply download the TextEditor.jar file, or everything if you're curious, and run the TextEditor.jar file.

### Features
* Ability to Open/Save files
* Line numbering
* Some Java syntax highlighting (Toggleable)
* Set font size
* Tabs!

### Notes
This was made with the help of an extra library called [RSyntaxTextArea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea) made by GitHub user bobbylight.

I also used a library called [JTatto](http://www.jtattoo.net/) for my theme

### TODO
* Fix bugs if I discover them
* All done, if you have any feature requests, let me know.  I can't garuntee I'll be capable of everything you think of though.

### BUGS
* If the user makes/closes too many tabs in a short amount of time, the program can't keep up with the count and mis selects tabs and things like the "+" tab can be accidentally closed.
